     Day 2    Workshop ML

# For streaming ur project u need website, app, or cloud
# Streamlit is one alternative where u don't need to make website on your own
import streamlit
streamlit.title("GDSC NMIT")
streamlit.header("Deep learning with Tensorflow")
streamlit.sidebar.markdown('### This is a markdown text')
streamlit.sidebar.write('#### This is a normal text')
o= streamlit.button("Click")
img= streamlit.file_uploader("upload your file")
# to run the code in terminal : streamlit run app.py


VGG- 16 CNN Model
Different CNN architecture- Interview ques
Normalisation happens only when u have traing data from 1-255


Steps to follow to solve any computervision problem-
1. Import
2. Download Dataset
3. ImageData Generator
4. Analyze the data
5. Visualize
6. CNN Model
7. Techniques to reduce overfit
   - Data Augmentation technique
   - Dropout - to reduce overtraining of model  # model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.5))
   - Regularisation - to add complexity  # model.add(keras.layers.Dense(128,activation="relu",kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.L2(0.01)))
8. Compile and fit
9. Predict
10. Real-time

whenever you get lookup error then download the library required that will be given in error block itself , add those and run if it shows true then delete after execution
